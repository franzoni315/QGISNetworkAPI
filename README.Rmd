# QGIS Desktop Network API and remote control plugin

This plugin provides a web service API that exposes QGIS' data processing and canvas drawing functionalities. The plugin provides a way to include QGIS in the data processing workflow of other (‘mapping-deficient’) programming languages over a HTTP interface which mirrors the existing QGIS API, without precluding the ability to make use of its interactive editing components. It is currently under development as part of [this Google Summer of Code 2017 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5197021490184192).

## Testing

The plugin is currently under development so there is not a whole lot of (reliable) documentation. You can nevertheless try out and help test the current development version of the plugin:

1. Install the plugin into your $QGIS_HOME/plugins/ folder, either by `git clone`ing this repository or by downloading the latest snapshot as a [zip file](https://gitlab.com/qgisapi/networkapi/repository/archive.zip?ref=master).
2. In QGIS (2.*), activate the plugin under Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > 'Network API'
3. Once activated, the plugin will automatically start listening for (and accept all) connections on port 8090. (The plugin dialog is currently just a mockup, it is not configurable yet.)
4. Access the web service API, currently implemented requests/paths can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/qgisapi/networkapi/blob/master/network_api_functions.py). Some example commands that can be run from your console:

```{bash}
# make sure QGIS Desktop 2.* is running with the Network Plugin enabled, then:
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapLayers
```

```{bash}
# add some vector data from the web
curl --silent 'http://localhost:8090/qgis/addVectorLayer?url=https://d2ad6b4ur7yvpq.cloudfront.net/naturalearth-3.3.0/ne_50m_populated_places.geojson&name=url-layer'
```

```{bash}
# add another layer as POST data
if [ ! -f "ne_50m_populated_places.geojson" ]; then
  wget https://d2ad6b4ur7yvpq.cloudfront.net/naturalearth-3.3.0/ne_50m_populated_places.geojson
fi
curl --silent -d @ne_50m_populated_places.geojson http://localhost:8090/qgis/addVectorLayer?name=geojson-layer
```

```{bash}
# retrieve layer information
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapLayers
```

```{bash}
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/extent
```

```{bash}
# adjust view
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/zoomToFullExtent
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/extent
```

```{bash}
# read current canvas content
wget --no-verbose http://127.0.0.1:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/image
file "image"
```

```{bash}
wget --no-verbose http://127.0.0.1:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/image?format=jpg
file "image?format=jpg"
```

```{bash}
# retrieve current scale
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/scale
```

```{bash}
# some more canvas manipulation
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/zoomIn
```

```{bash}
curl --silent http://localhost:8090/qgis/mapCanvas/zoomScale?scale=1234567.8
```

The motivation behind this plugin is to make QGIS interface components available and scriptable from other mapping-averse programming language such as R. Development versions of the corresponding R package making use of this Network API can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/qgisapi/rqgisapi).

For using QGIS processing routines from R (geared towards performing large scale data mangling without making use of QGIS UI components, with a significant overhead per processing invocation), have a look at the [RQGIS package](https://github.com/jannes-m/RQGIS).
